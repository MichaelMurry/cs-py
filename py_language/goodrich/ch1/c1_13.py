# C-1.13: Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n integers, so that the numbers
# are listed in the opposite order than they were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
# for doing the same thing.

# define reverse list called 'r'
# define and initialize counter called 'j' to zero
# Reverse loop through n list
    # store ith item in n list to jth item in r list
